# HW-4-CodingQuiz

# Approach

This assignment was extremely difficult for me. I got stuck on incorporation of the for loop and set up the HTML wrong from the start which crippled me later in the assignment. I was able to find a workaround to allow me to navigate through the quiz but it is still inconsistent and falls apart after 9 total hours of working, deleting and re-writing code.

I will be revisiting this assignment after diligently reviewing the solution and building out a better understanding of how to approach problems through coding.
